# LIVE SELECT

# `LIVE SELECT` statement

The `LIVE SELECT` statement can be used to initiate a real-time selection from a table, including the option to apply filters.

In practical terms, when you execute a `LIVE SELECT` query, it triggers an ongoing session that captures any subsequent changes to the data in real-time. These changes are then immediately transmitted to the client, ensuring that the client is consistently updated with the latest data modifications.

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
LIVE SELECT
	[
		[ VALUE ] @fields [ AS @alias ]
		| DIFF
	]
	FROM @targets
	[ WHERE @conditions ]
	[ FETCH @fields ... ]
;
```

:::note
Support for FETCH is not yet available, but we are working on it.

## Example usage
### Basic usage

By default, SurrealDB will push the entire record over the websocket when created or updated, and just the record's ID when deleted.

```surql
LIVE SELECT * FROM person;
```

The result of the above query will be a UUID.
This UUID is the Live Query Unique ID, and is used to differentate between different Live Queries.
You will want to keep track of this ID, so that you can differentiate between different notifications being received after this query.
You can also use this UUID to KILL (stop) the Live Quyery.

### Diff 

When using the `DIFF` mode, updates will be sent in the form of an array with [JSON Patch](https://jsonpatch.com/) messages.

```surql
LIVE SELECT DIFF FROM person;
```
### Filter the live query

You can optionally apply filters with the `WHERE` clause.

```surql
LIVE SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 18;
```
